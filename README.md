# Comparing Simple Smoothing Filters with Advanced Filters on Noisy Images

This project explores the effectiveness of simple and advanced smoothing filters in reducing noise while preserving image details. Various filters, including Box, Gaussian, Median, Adaptive Mean, Adaptive Median, and Bilateral filters, are applied to noisy images with different kernel sizes. Performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), edge preservation analysis, and computational efficiency. The results highlight the trade-offs between noise removal, edge retention, and processing speed, offering insights into the optimal selection of filters and kernel sizes for different applications.
